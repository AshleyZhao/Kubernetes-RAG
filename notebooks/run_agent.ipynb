      "MessageRole.USER: How to deploy pods?\n",
      "MessageRole.AGENT: To deploy pods in Kubernetes, you typically use a `Pod` manifest. You can create a Pod directly, but it is more common to deploy Pods as part of a higher-level abstraction like a Deployment or a ReplicaSet. Here’s how you can proceed using both methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using a Standalone Pod Manifest\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create a Pod Manifest**: You will create a YAML file for your Pod. Here’s an example:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```yaml\n",
      "    apiVersion: v1\n",
      "    kind: Pod\n",
      "    metadata:\n",
      "      name: my-pod\n",
      "    spec:\n",
      "      containers:\n",
      "      - name: my-container\n",
      "        image: nginx\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Deploy the Pod**: Use the following command to create the Pod:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```bash\n",
      "    kubectl apply -f my-pod.yaml\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using a Deployment\n",
      "\n",
      "Using a Deployment is often preferred because it provides updates and rollback capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create a Deployment Manifest**: Here’s an example of a Deployment YAML file:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```yaml\n",
      "    apiVersion: apps/v1\n",
      "    kind: Deployment\n",
      "    metadata:\n",
      "      name: my-deployment\n",
      "    spec:\n",
      "      replicas: 3\n",
      "      selector:\n",
      "        matchLabels:\n",
      "          app: my-app\n",
      "      template:\n",
      "        metadata:\n",
      "          labels:\n",
      "            app: my-app\n",

      "            image: nginx\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Deploy the Deployment**: Create the Deployment using:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```bash\n",
      "    kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Verify the Pods**: After deploying, verify that your Pods are running with:\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```bash\n",
      "    kubectl get pods\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Guidance\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Namespaces**: If you are working in different namespaces, you might want to specify the namespace in your command or in your manifest file. Use `-n <namespace-name>` with `kubectl` commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Logging and Monitoring**: After your Pods are up, consider implementing logging and monitoring solutions (like Prometheus, Grafana) for effective management.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Scaling**: If using a Deployment, you can easily scale your application by increasing the `replicas` count in your Deployment manifest and applying it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Health Checks**: Implement readiness and liveness probes in your container specifications to help Kubernetes manage your Pods effectively.\n",

      "### Restarting a Pod Steps\n",
